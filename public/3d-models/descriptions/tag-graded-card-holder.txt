One of my more "childish" interests is Pokemon. I'm also quite a data and numbers nerd... When I got married in 2025, I wanted to get my groomsmen a unique gift from me as a reminder of our friendship and as a thank you for being apart of my wedding.
A graded card from TAG combined both of these interests extremely well so I picked out a unique Mint 10 card that reminded me of them in some way. I then designed and printed out this Card Holder stand so that they could easily display the card on a desk or shelf.
I printed these in PETG as I wanted them to be more sturdy and strong compared to something like PLA. My personal favorite Pokemon is Snorlax, so you can see my personal Mint 10 Snorlax from the Twilight Masquerade set below.
