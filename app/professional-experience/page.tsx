      'Designed, built, and deployed a self-service machine learning application for free-text classification. This system automated classification from user-defined and labeled datasets, integrating with real-time and batch sources for prediction serving, and offering continuous model retraining and prediction visualization to convert thousands of weekly unstructured data points into actionable feedback for the business.',
      'Designed, architected, and developed a Three.js-powered Balance of System (BOS) design application for residential solar and battery systems. This interactive tool leveraged site survey photos for automated wall and obstruction dimensioning, enabling rapid design with built-in compliance checks against all relevant regulatory constraints. Its implementation significantly reduced permit rejections and customer redesigns, while establishing a robust data foundation for future AI-driven design automation.',
      'Drove continuous improvement and evolution of critical batch and real-time process automations, contributing to over 20% reduction in cycle times over the last 24 months while optimizing customer progression and maximizing revenue across the full business lifecycle (from order to system activation).',
